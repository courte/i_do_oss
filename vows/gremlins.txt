I take you, Gizmo, to be my lawfully wedded wife to have and to hold in sickness and in health. I also swear to do everything I can to protect you from being doused in water so that we can live peacefully in a desert. Though in the off chance that does occur I will make sure to keep tons of food and sunglasses around for the off-spring.
